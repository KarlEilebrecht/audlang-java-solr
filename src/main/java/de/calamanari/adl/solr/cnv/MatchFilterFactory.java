/**
 * A {@link MatchFilterFactory} abstracts the creation of a single Solr match condition (field against value, field against multiple values, field against
 * field).
 * <p>
 * A complex Solr-query works on "data sets". Starting with a basic super-set (often <code>*:*</code>) every <i>positive</i> condition added using
 * <code><b>AND</b></code> reduces this set.<br>
 * On the other hand if you concatenate conditions using <code><b>OR</b></code> can increase the size of the result set.
 * <p>
 * Negations are more complicated. A negation means an exclusion (this is equivalent to Audlang's default negation, see also
 * <a href="https://github.com/KarlEilebrecht/audlang-spec/blob/main/doc/AudienceDefinitionLanguageSpecification.md#51-default-negation">ยง5.1 Audlang Spec</a>).
 * This is the reason why Solr-queries of the form <code>(color:blue AND shape:square) OR NOT color:blue</code> don't work. The set
 * <code>OR NOT color:blue</code> means subtracting <code>color:blue</code> from <i>nothing</i>. Consequently, it is empty and won't contribute to the result
 * set. To fix this, we must ensure that the <code>OR'd</code> set is not empty by starting with a positive base set:
 * <code>(color:blue AND shape:square) OR (*:* AND NOT color:blue)</code>.<br>
 * Nested or dependent documents create another challenge. The aforementioned sets contain main documents (the contributions to the result). So, every condition
 * must be created in a way that it results in a set of main documents, even if the attributes sit on a nested or dependent document. This also means that a
 * negative condition may be fulfilled because (1) the attribute is present and has a different value <i><b>or</b></i> (2) the attribute is not present
 * <i><b>or</b></i> (3) the sub-document is not present. The last two options are <i>not</i> STRICT!
 * <p>
 * Not to mingle all these concerns, a <b>{@link MatchFilterFactory} only creates positive conditions</b> (restricting filter expressions) and leaves dealing
 * with negations entirely to the calling component.
